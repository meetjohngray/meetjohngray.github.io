          <h1>Sprint 3 Cultural: Emotional Intelligence</h1>

          <p>Developing Emotional intelligence (EQ) is a key focus of both my personal and personal life. I spent many years working in outdoor education where the primary focus was helping students learn about and grow their EQ. In my personal life, meditation, journaling and other EQ boosting practices such as yoga play an integral role in my daily living. The benefits I have seen in developing EQ in both myself and others have convinced me of how powerful and transformative this work can be.</p>
          
          <p>Emotional Intelligence has been defined as follows:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.</p>
          
          <p>Salovey and Mayer 1990</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Whereas an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) represents characteristics such as visual/spatial processing, reasoning, memory, and knowledge of the world, EQ is concerned with an individual’s ability to identify emotions in themselves and others, learning to control one’s emotions, and relating well with others.<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Studies have shown that EQ plays an important role in determining how successful a person will be. At Enspiral Dev Academy believes that the three main benefits of strengthening EQ include:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Stellar Performance
            <li>Outstanding Leadership</li>
            <li>Happiness<sup><a id="ffn2" href="#fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>Fortunately, EQ is a skill that can be trained.</p>
          
          <p>In my previous work at the <a href="https://www.ncobs.org" title="North Carolina Outward Bound School">North Carolina Outward Bound School</a> and at <a href="https://www.enf.org/outdoor-academy/">The Outdoor Academy</a>, I helped students develop EQ through placing students in increasingly challenging situations while teaching interpersonal, introspection, and communication skills. By overcoming difficulties that were physical, mental, and emotional, our student’s increased awareness of their own thoughts, emotions and actions and how they impacted those around them. Through this work, I also have come to a better understanding of my own EQ and how I can continue to develop it.</p>

          <p>My personal EQ practice includes daily meditation and journaling. I have found meditation to be an ideal way for me to get in touch with what’s going on inside. It helps me to connect with my thoughts and emotions. More importantly, meditation has taught me how to not identify too strongly with these things, to realise that thoughts and emotions come and go in rapid succession. By helping me to listen to what’s inside me, the practice of meditation has also helped me to listen better to others.</p>
          
          <p>Journaling is the other big part of my personal work with EQ. It gives me a space to express whatever is going on inside. It is a space to clear out my mental clutter. Sometimes when my spoken words fail me, I use journaling to improve my communication with others.</p>

          <p>Emotional intelligence is easy to practice but nearly impossible to master. Just when I think I’ve learned a few things about it, some major life event or random interaction will let me know just how much more I have to learn. Developing good EQ is a worthwhile pursuit that leads to greater self-awareness, better relationships with others, and a more contented life.</p>
