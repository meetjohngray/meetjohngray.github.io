          <p><strong>A Perfect Day</strong></p>

          <p><em>I get out of bed around 5 am, feeling awake, alive, and excited to start the day. I do some yoga and mediate to bring a sense of calm and settledness to my body and mind. I prepare a warm beverage and I sit down to write in a place with windows all around so I can witness the coming of the light. </em></p>
          
          <p><em>I then go for a run. While running, I sometimes listen to podcasts to inspire me or further my knowledge and understanding of things. Returning home, I eat a healthy breakfast, often involving a green smoothie.</em></p>
          
          <p><em>I sit down someplace light and airy to begin the day’s work. It is something that involves creativity and problem solving. I do the important work tasks in the hours before having lunch. Sometimes, I do this work at a local coffee shop or co-working space in order to be around the energy of other people. I listen to relaxing music during some of this work time.</em></p>
          
          <p><em>I go for a short walk after lunch, and then work a few more hours. Mid-afternoon, I read a book for half and hour, then take a quick nap. This is followed by another hour or so of work, doing the tasks that don’t require as much brain power. I then begin preparing a healthy dinner, which I eat with my partner while discussing the day. After dinner, maybe another short walk to enjoy the changing light of the evening, then more reading or occasionally a movie before going to bed.</em></p>
          
          <p>This story illustrates what I value: a simple life where I take good care of my mind and body, spending time outdoors, learning, and doing work that I find stimulating and creative. I also value connections with others. As an introvert, I generally prefer interacting one-on-one or in a small group, but I do occasionally like to ham it up for a crowd.</p>
          
          <p>A situation in which I had an ethical decision to make involved having to ask a co-worker to take a leave of absence. It was in an outdoor education setting where staff lived together when not leading trips with students. This co-worker was one of the best instructors I had ever observed and did outstanding work with our students. However, their behaviour within the community was disruptive and made other staff members uncomfortable. Though it was a difficult decision knowing our students would be deprived of such a gifted teacher, I had to ask them to leave because I valued the community of the teaching team over how much I valued this individual’s friendship and good work with the students.</p>
          
          <p>Though I’ve spent most of my life in the United States, I have often felt like my values are at odds with some of the cultural norms there. I’ve never been much interested in pursuing ever greater amounts of wealth and possessions. I value just having enough and would rather have experiences than things. I am happy to now be living in a country that seems to align more with my values in regards to community and equality.</p>
          
          <p>My strengths include knowing I have the mental fortitude to complete difficult tasks. This is sometimes counterbalanced by a tendency to give-up on something if it’s not coming easily for me. I tend to pick up on the basics of things quickly, but sometimes once I’ve got those down, I decide to move on to something else. Though I have achieved some level of skill in many different areas, I have mastered few. It will be interesting to see how these tendencies come into conflict with one another during my studies at Dev Academy.</p>
          
          <p>I once had a co-worker who also happened to be a friend of mine. Our styles in the way we approached problems often created tension between us. They seemed to always want more information before making decisions whereas my style was more to try something out and trust that our experience would help us to make it a success. At times this created strong disagreements as we were both stubborn in our opinions. This led to some stalemates that were difficult to work our way out of.</p>
          
          <p>As I’ve grown older and hopefully wiser, I am less enamoured with my own opinions. I am much more open to all that I do not know. This has enabled me to listen and collaborate with others without being so attached to the way I think things should be. I try and stay focused on the desired results and know that there are usually many valid paths to get there. </p>
          
          <p>To sum it up, I wrote a mission statement back in 2014 that still feels valid today.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>I will be a kind person, with a healthy body and mind, living a life dedicated to having new experiences, traveling, and learning. I will spend time with loved ones. I will use writing and meditation to stay connected to life.</p>
