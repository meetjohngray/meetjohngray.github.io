          <h1>Sprint 5 Cultural</h1>

          <p>
            Last night I attended an EDA graduation and it filled me with inspiration and motivation for what lies ahead. It’s hard to believe how fast Foundations has flown by. The Foundations Core and Technical learnings have been valuable experiences that have helped me to think about myself and where I hope my learning journey will lead.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Core Skills</h2>
          
          <p>
            I came into EDA with some background in the Core Skills curriculum. Much of what was taught mirrored learnings I have had while working in the field of outdoor education, where we put a big emphasis on personal growth and working well with others. What surprised me most about the core learning was how much of an emphasis EDA places on it. I am happy to see this material incorporated into a setting where most people would not expect it.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Software has great power to do good in the world. Conversely, the past few years have demonstrated it can also have some very unfortunate and damaging side effects. We have seen it been used to spread violence, hate, and propaganda. In and of itself, software has no values, self-awareness, or empathy. It doesn’t think about the consequences of its actions. That is where we as developers must step in and take responsibility. This is at the heart of why the Core curriculum at EDA is important.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Thinking about what we value will allow us as programmers to have a map of what we hope our products will achieve and to minimise any negative consequences. Self-awareness can shine a light on our motivations about the things we are building. Bringing empathy to our work will help us to make things that are useful to others without causing undue harm.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            While working through the core lessons, I learned to ask for help when I need it. It was great to reach out to the EDA staff while working on campus as well as to look towards my peers on slack for a helpful hint while working on minesweeper. I also learned that I can stay focused for long periods at a time when I’m working on something that I find interesting or challenging.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Though I am happy to have the core learning play such an important role at EDA, this has also been a challenge for me. After spending so much of my working life thinking about aspects of this material, I just wanted to focus on the technical content. That being said, though I have familiarity with the core teachings, I am far from being a master and I have much room for growth. I also recognise that in addition to what I have already written, EDA places a strong emphasis on the core learnings because they are what employers want. My own working life bears this out. No matter what career a person chooses, self-awareness, empathy, and having a set of values can be far more important than whatever knowledge or skills they bring.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Learning Reflection</h2>
          
          <p>
            <strong>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            There are many avenues I would be interested in pursuing. I like helping others, so teaching is one possible pathway. I also have high freedom needs, so I like the idea of remote work and contract work. These things would also support my love of travel. On the technical side, at present, I have more of an interest in the frontend of software development and in UI/UX design, but I am open to wherever my learning leads me. More important than any of the above is that I want my work to support my values and to do meaningful good. In this regard, working for a non-profit or an educational organisation is appealing.

            <strong> What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong>
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Strengths: A good sense of perspective. The knowledge that I can endure difficult challenges. Empathy and kindness towards others. These will help me be a good team member.
            </li>
            <li>
              Limitations: My ability to comprehend the technical material. Software documentation still looks like a foreign language to me.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            <strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I worry about maintaining my relationships outside Bootcamp as well as not getting down on myself when things are difficult. These two are closely related. When I don’t feel good about myself, my relationships with others suffer.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>What non-technical skills — human skills — would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I want to work on my growth mindset and on being a really supportive member of the team for others. Also, my ability to stay focused and present. As a U.S. citizen, I am currently way too preoccupied with continuing bad news from the States.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            My expectations for myself are to make Bootcamp the main focus of my life while still allowing space for self-care through running, meditation, journaling, and yoga. These things will enhance my learning as they will provide my mind and body space to absorb all the learning that will be occurring and also to decompress. For technical help, I will look to my facilitators and fellow cohort members. I am committed to doing the work that is required to complete the program and to be a supportive member of the learning community at EDA.
