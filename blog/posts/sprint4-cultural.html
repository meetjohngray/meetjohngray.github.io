            <blockquote>
                <strong>Any man could, if he were so inclined, be the sculptor of his own brain.</strong>
            </blockquote>
          </p>

          <p>
            So said the Santiago Ramón y Cajal who first articulated the idea “neuronal plasticity” in the early 1900s. Now known as neuroplasticity, this concept has broad implications in many areas of human growth and potential. It affects things as disparate as our ability to recover from injury, dealing with psychological issues, and influencing how we learn.
          </pp>

          <p>
            Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt.
            <blockquote>
                Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences. <sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
            </blockquote>
          </p>  

          <p>
            Think about that. With effort, we can adapt our brains to new situations and information. This is truly remarkable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Neuroplasticity has demonstrated benefits in the following areas:
            <ul>
              <li>Helping people recovery from medical conditions such as strokes and traumatic brain injuries</li>
              <li>The rewiring of senses to strengthen one or more if there is a deficiency in another</li>
              <li>Enhancing memory and cognitive ability</li>
              <li>More effective learning</li>
              <li>Coping with psychological conditions such as depression and anxiety</li>
            </ul>
          </p>  

          <p>
            Some ways to increase neuroplasticity include<sup><a id="ffn2" href="#fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>:

            <ul>
              <li>Intermittent Fasting</li>
              <li>Traveling</li>
              <li>Using mnemonic devices</li>
              <li>Learning a musical instrument</li>
              <li>Non-dominant hand exercises</li>
              <li>Reading fiction</li>
              <li>Expanding your vocabulary</li>
              <li>Creating artwork</li>
              <li>Dancing</li>
              <li>Sleeping</li>
              <li>Meditation</li>
            </ul>

            From that list, it seems clear that any of us should be able to find something that we enjoy doing that has the added benefit of increasing our neuroplasticity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Neuroplasticity goes hand in hand with the concept of having a growth mindset. A growth mindset is the idea our abilities can be developed and improved over time with practice and determination. This contrasts with a fixed mindset, one where a person believes they can’t change or learn new things. A growth mindset “embraces mistakes as opportunities to learn”<sup><a id="ffn3" href="#fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.
          </p>

            </iframe>
          </figure>

          <p>
            There are many ways to develop a growth mindset<sup><a id="ffn4" href="#fn4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. Some that resonate with me include:

            <ul>
              <li>Acknowledging and embracing imperfection</li>
              <li>Paying attention to my thoughts and words</li>
              <li>Valuing the process over the result</li>
            </ul>

            For me, having a growth mindset can be summed up in the words of Kurt Hahn, one of the founder’s of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outward_Bound">Outward Bound</a>.

            <blockquote>
              Your disability is your opportunity.
            </blockquote>
          </p>

          <p>
            As I move into the challenge of a coding bootcamp, I need to keep in mind the concepts of neuroplasticity and growth mindset. There will be times when I feel like I can’t accomplish what is asked of me. But if I maintain a growth mindset, then neuroplasticity will kick in, allowing me to learn and acquire the new skills and knowledge I need to be successful.
