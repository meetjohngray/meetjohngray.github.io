            <p><strong>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</strong></p>

            <p>I want to gain the skills needed for entry level employment in software development. Ideally this would be with a company or organisation that I feel aligns with my personal values and is making a positive contribution to the world. In the long term, I would love to be able to work remotely so that I could incorporate some long-term travel into my life. At this time I see myself more interested in front-end development, but I am also open to follow wherever my curiosity leads me. I also think I would enjoy and have some aptitude in project management. <strong></strong></p>

            <p><strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong></p>

            <p>I would like more practice on how to work well with others, especially in the context of completing shared projects. I’d also like to work on being a good support/mentor for others in my cohort. As an older student, I feel I might have something to offer in this area. To do this well, I’ll have to manage my own feelings of overwhelm and identify in what areas I can be a valuable resource to my peers.</p>

            <p><strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations</strong></p>

            <ul>
              <li>I have succeeded at difficult tasks before: completing a semester long Outward Bound program, a 10-day silent meditation retreat, etc.</li>
              <li>I pick up on the basics of things quickly</li>
              <li>I generally get along with and work well with others</li>
              <li>I am humble about what I don’t know</li>
              <li>I have some good strategies for managing stress</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>

            <ul>
              <li>If things don’t come easily for me, I sometimes give up</li>
              <li>I get bored with things quickly and want to move on to something else</li>
              <li>I don’t think I’m very good at math</li>
              <li>Despite my good strategies, stress can sometimes feel overwhelming to me</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</strong></p>

            <p>I am committed to putting in the time and effort required to complete this program. I am an early riser and will use those hours productively. I will manage my stress through running, yoga, and meditation. If I am feeling overwhelmed, I will step away to take a walk. I will use the experiences I’ve had in the past while working with others under stressful situations and use strategies the I have found effective such as listening, empathy, and humour. I will respect and value the opinions and backgrounds of those I come into contact with and try and always remember that everyone has something to teach me.</p>

            <p><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</strong></p>

            <p>I am committed to seeking help when needed from the teaching faculty, my fellow cohort members, and friends outside of the program. I will do this through one-on-one interactions, messaging software, and phone calls. </p>

            <p><strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</strong></p>

            <p>I expect teaching that will cater to the various different levels of knowledge and learning styles of my cohort. I expect timely feedback on my performance. I expect encouragement and honesty. I expect them to push me if they think I could be doing more.</p>

            <p><strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</strong></p>

            <p>Not at this time.</p>
